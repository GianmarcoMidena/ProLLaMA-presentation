	\begin{enumerate}\setlength\itemsep{1em}
		%\item Are current ProLLMs really unable to follow instructions? How did ProLLaMA authors realize that?
		\item Why does the quality of proteins generated by ProLLaMA increase as their sequence length increases? Why does ESM2 behave in the opposite way? What about other models?
		\item Isn't there any better model to compare with?
		\item Why exactly the SAM-MT, TPHD, Trx, CheY superfamilies have been selected to instruct ProLLaMA in controlled protein generation?
		\item How well do other models perform in protein property prediction?
		\item What if the generation of single proteins is controlled by multiple superfamilies instead of just one?
		\item What are some additional tasks to train the model in?
		\item How much does the subset of tasks learned simultaneously influence ProLLaMA performance in one specific task?
